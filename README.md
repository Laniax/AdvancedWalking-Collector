## AdvancedWalking-Collector
Using this Collector you can collect tile data from the runescape map.
The AdvancedWalking-Generator project is able to read this data and produce navmesh data, which can then be used by the main AdvancedWalking project to pathfind on.

## Dependencies
This project requires LanAPI. (It does NOT need any other AdvancedWalking part)
